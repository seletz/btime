* Description

This is a small utility program which reads a source file's birth timestamp and sets
the deftination files's access and modificaction time to that value.

This can probably done with some flags of `rsync` or even `cp`, but I took this opportunity
to write some C again.  Memories ...

* Use Case

I wanted to sync some files to iCloud, but somehow iCloud sync fscks up time stamps.  As
I use a note keeping tool which uses modificaction time stamps, this distorted note sorting
which was extremely annoying.
